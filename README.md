## PROJECT: Using Data Science and Machine Learning to Explore Water Use Habit of Noah's Residents.

In this project, we explore the habit of using water in Noah by inspecting the dataset from the Oberlin Environmental Dashboard. We looked at how the water usage changes throughout the last 5 years, each month of 2021 and 2022, and every weekdays and weekends on average. We also built a Machine Learning model to predict the water usage at a given timestamp on a given day.

The full detail is in the file 'shower.ipynb'.
