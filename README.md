Project idea: We want to answer some research questions from the large amount of data we have.

### Research questions:
1. When should we take a shower?
	- What factors should we consider when deciding whether to shower or not?
		- Priority…
	- What kind of data should we make use of?
	- How can we get that data?
	- How should we preprocess given data?
	- What model should we use?
	- What relationships should we pay attention to?
		- What is the relationship between water usage and weather temperature?
		- How about water usage and specific events (midterms, finals, break,...etc…)?
		- Water usage and Electricity usage?
	- After we get our results, how do we present it effectively (how to visualize)
	
2. Throughout ten years of collected data, what are some significant and unexpected changes? (Tell a story)
	- What can we learn from those changes?
		- When?
		- Why? 
	- Are they good or bad? What can we do to manipulate them?

3. Have Oberlin’s measures to alleviate Global Warming been adequate for the last ten years?
	- What measures has Oberlin used to alleviate global warming in the last 10 years?
	- How can we measure global warming? What factors should we consider?
	- How significant are the changes made by those measures? (Compared to other schools or organizations)
	- Are those measures worth it?
	- What are some other measures Oberlin can use instead?
